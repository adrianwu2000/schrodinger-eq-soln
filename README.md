# Solving the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation in 1D and 2D
This project provides numerical solutions to the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) time-dependent Schrödinger equations, foundational equations in quantum mechanics. Using methods like the Crank-Nicolson discretization for 1D and the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) technique for 2D, we approximate these equations and conduct convergence tests. This project also visualizes solutions to the 2D Schrödinger equation, showing the wavefunction's evolution over time in various potential fields.

### Visualization

Animations in 2D illustrate the interaction of the wavefunction with different potentials, demonstrating phenomena such as reflection, tunneling, and probability distribution shifts.
