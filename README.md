# Solving the Time-Dependent Schr√∂dinger Equation in 1D and 2D
In the realm of quantum mechanics, the Schrodinger equation stands as a cornerstone, providing a mathematical framework to describe the behavior of particles at the smallest scales. This project delves into the task of solving the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) time-dependent Schrodinger equations using the Crank-Nicolson approach and the ADI technique. After solving them, we will perform convergence testing on them. Additionally, we will try to make animations of the 2D solution as it interacts with different potentials, similar to those that we study. 

Please see the sch_eq_overview.pdf for a more detailed explanation. A review of the numerical approach and discretization are found there. 

### Visualization
Convergence testing was performed in both the 1D and 2D cases.

Animations in 2D illustrate the interaction of the wavefunction with different potentials, demonstrating phenomena such as reflection and the double slit diffraction. Click on the thumbnail below to view the full animation.
